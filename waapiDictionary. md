# Web Animations API: Objects, Properties, and Methods

## 1. `Animation` Interface

* **Properties:**
    * `currentTime`: Gets or sets the current playback time of the animation.
    * `effect`: Gets or sets the `AnimationEffect` associated with the animation.
    * `finished`: Returns a `Promise` that resolves when the animation finishes.
    * `id`: Gets or sets the ID of the animation.
    * `oncancel`: Gets or sets an event handler for the `cancel` event.
    * `onfinish`: Gets or sets an event handler for the `finish` event.
    * `pending`: Returns a boolean indicating whether the animation's playback is currently pending.
    * `playState`: Returns the current playback state of the animation (e.g., "idle", "running", "finished", "paused").
    * `playbackRate`: Gets or sets the playback rate of the animation.
    * `ready`: Returns a `Promise` that resolves when the animation is ready to play.
    * `startTime`: Gets or sets the scheduled start time of the animation.
    * `timeline`: Gets or sets the `AnimationTimeline` associated with the animation.
* **Methods:**
    * `cancel()`: Cancels the animation.
    * `finish()`: Finishes the animation.
    * `pause()`: Pauses the animation.
    * `play()`: Starts or resumes the animation.
    * `reverse()`: Reverses the playback direction of the animation.
    * `updatePlaybackRate(playbackRate)`: Updates the playback rate of the animation.

## 2. `AnimationEffect` Interface

* **Properties:**
    * `timing`: Gets or sets the timing properties for the animation effect.
* **Methods:**
    * `getComputedTiming()`: Returns the computed timing properties for the animation effect.
    * `getKeyframes()`: Returns the keyframes associated with the animation effect.
    * `updateTiming(timing)`: Updates the timing properties for the animation effect.

## 3. `KeyframeEffect` Interface (inherits from `AnimationEffect`)

* **Constructor:**
    * `KeyframeEffect(target, keyframes, options)`: Creates a new `KeyframeEffect`.
* **Properties:**
    * `target`: Gets or sets the target element of the keyframe effect.
    * `keyframes`: Gets or sets the keyframes of the keyframe effect.

## 4. `AnimationTimeline` Interface

* **Properties:**
    * `currentTime`: Gets or sets the current time of the animation timeline.
* **Methods:**
    * `getAnimations()`: Returns a list of animations associated with the timeline.

## 5. `DocumentTimeline` Interface (inherits from `AnimationTimeline`)

* This is the default timeline associated with the document. It is available as `document.timeline`.

## 6. `KeyframeEffectOptions` Dictionary

* `composite`: How to combine the values of this keyframe effect with the underlying value.
* `delay`: The number of milliseconds to delay starting the animation.
* `direction`: The playback direction of the animation.
* `duration`: The duration of the animation in milliseconds.
* `easing`: The easing function to use for the animation.
* `endDelay`: The number of milliseconds to delay ending the animation.
* `fill`: How the animation should apply styles before and after its active period.
* `iterationComposite`: How to combine multiple iterations of the animation.
* `iterations`: The number of iterations to play the animation.
* `iterationStart`: The starting iteration of the animation.

## 7. `EffectTiming` Dictionary

* This dictionary is used to specify timing properties for `AnimationEffect` objects. It includes properties such as `delay`, `duration`, `easing`, `fill`, and `iterations`.
