  `My teachers look at me funny when I make weird`,
  `noises, but my friends, they usually just laugh.`,
  `It's funny to them, and they are pretty cool`,
  `about it—they don't make fun of me really, but`,
  `only get a kick out of it—like when we are in`,
  `the middle of a test or something, and then out`,
  `of nowhere I let out a bark, I mean a loud bark,`,
  `where everyone turns around to me and smiles,`,
  `and then someone starts laughing, and then`,
  `everyone else gets going. To tell you the truth,`,
  `it doesn't bother meat all, and I laugh right`,
  `along with them most of the time.`
], [
  `I go to this school where our teachers are`,
  `mostly nuns—we have to go to church every week,`,
  `and sometimesI'll bark in church too. This one`,
  `nun, Sister Agatha,told me that Jesus didn't`,
  `appreciate me barking like that in church and`,
  `disrupting everything. She's mean though—it's`,
  `funny—there's always that question about nuns—`,
  `"is she mean?"—that everyone's always talkin'`,
  `about—whenever you find out who your teachers`,
  `will be for the next year, it's always how mean`,
  `Sister so and so is, and how this one cuts your`,
  `hair when you're not looking if it grows too`,
  `long, and how another one will ask you to hold`,
  `your palms out so she can smack 'em with a`,
  `ruler. My brother told me all kinds of horrible`,
  `stuff about every nun I was gonna' have—but with`,
  `Sister Agatha, he wasn't kidding. Yesterday,`,
  `after telling me all about how Jesus didn't`,
  `appreciate me disrupting His Mass, she smacked`,
  `me in the back of the head, and told me maybe`,
  `that will stop me from shaking it.`
], [
  `I figured though, that Jesus didn't mind so much`,
  `—since I prayed to Him all the time to help me`,
  `to stop shaking my head, and barking, though it`,
  `never seemed to help. The way I see it, if He`,
  `didn't want to help, then He probably didn't`,
  `care too much if I did it in church. Sister`,
  `Agatha and the rest of the teachers told my mom`,
  `that I was forever disrupting the classes and`,
  `Masses,and that they were thinking of taking`,
  `further action if I didn't stop, whatever that's`,
  `supposed to mean. What they were going to do I`,
  `don't know—but my mom thought something was`,
  `wrong with me anyway, especially after this one`,
  `time when I called my basketball coach an`,
  `asshole right to his face for taking me outta'`,
  `the game.`
], [
  `The thing is, I couldn't help it—it just sorta'`,
  `came out of me. I used to go over to my friend`,
  `Justin's house all the time—but his dad was the`,
  `basketball coach, and ever since I called his`,
  `dad an asshole, I haven't been over there.`,
  `Justin looks at me funny in school sometimes,`,
  `like, 'Why'd you have to call my dad an asshole?`,
  `That's my dad, man'—and I feel real bad and all,`,
  `but like I said, I couldn't help it. Anyway, I still`,
  `still think he shouldn't have taken me outta'`,
  `the game.`
], [
  `My mom's taking me to the hospital today to see`,
  `if something's wrong with me. I do other weird`,
  `stuff too—like stomping my feet, and grunting,`,
  `and making my face all screwed up. Sometimes I`,
  `get real tired of it, and really want to stop,`,
  `but it's like I can't.`
], [
  `At first it was all a big joke—because there was`,
  `this one guy at the swimming pool—Crazy Charlie—`,
  `who would bark right before he dove off the high`,
  `dive and into the tank. He was an old man, and he`,
  `would do that same damn dive every time, like he`,
  `was trying out for the Olympics or something—but`,
  `every time his bony hands would hit the water`,
  `palms up, and his one leg never seemed to be`,
  `in line with the other one. Then he'd go up the`,
  `ladder doing these weird twitches, stand at the`,
  `end of the board, let out a bark, and then dive`,
  `again. It wasn't like a little bark either—it`,
  `was a loud bark and everyone always heard it and`,
  `would look up at his old ass getting ready to`,
  `dive, and laugh. We imitated him a lot, walking`,
  `around all the different parts of the pool,`,
  `barking and twitching, and yelling out "Crazy`,
  `Charlie!" 'cause a lot of times, Crazy Charlie`,
  `himself would do that while he was walking from`,
  `the showers to the diving tank.`
], [
  `Rivi is the name of the pool we all go to, and I`,
  `spend most of my summers there, except when I'm`,
  `at camp. It's like five pools all in one, 'cause`,
  `there are special parts of the pool for`,
  `different types of things. There'sa bullpen,`,
  `which is my favorite, where only boys are`,
  `allowed. If a girl gets caught in there, she`,
  `gets thrown out, and can't come back for a day.`,
  `Then there's the six foot where all the codgers`,
  `and old ladies do laps—the jackbox where most of`,
  `the girls hang out 'cause there's a bar there`,
  `where they can do somersaults and stuff—and`,
  `finally a baby and toddler pool which, rumor has`,
  `it, is two parts water, and one part urine.`
], [
  `Anyway, it was Crazy Charlie that got me goin'`,
  `makin' all these weird noises—'cause before that`,
  `I never did anything. I started makin' fun of`,
  `him like everyone else, and then one time he`,
  `looked at me, like I was the one who started all`,
  `of it, and barked right at me. Well, the only`,
  `thing I could do was bark right back, and when I`,
  `did, my friends all laughed real hard and patted`,
  `me on the back like it was a real good one or`,
  `somethin'.`
], [
  `The thing that I remember though, is when Crazy`,
  `Charlie was lookin' at me—it was like he musta'`,
  `been thinking of how either he hoped we all got`,
  `the barks so that we would stop laughing, or`,
  `that maybe he was hopin' that we would never get`,
  `'em, because it seemed to bother him a lot. Ever`,
  `since that day I've been doin' the barks and`,
  `twitches a lot, and I think maybe he gave 'em to`,
  `me when he looked right at me and I barked back`,
  `at him. My mom says that's ridiculous, but she`,
  `wasn't there to see the look Crazy Charlie gave`,
  `me. It wasn't like an adult look—it was the look`,
  `some kid gives you after you've made fun of him,`,
  `like he really hates you, and would like to kill`,
  `you right there on the spot.`
], [
  `In the bullpen there's this big guy that likes`,
  `to launch me into the air like a missile. That's`,
  `what they call me and my friends, missiles,`,
  `'cause they take one of our feet in their cupped`,
  `hands, and launch us through the air to see how`,
  `high they can throw us. Abe is the best`,
  `launcher—he's the biggest human being I've ever`,
  `seen,and when he launches me, I can see over the`,
  `fence of the club all the way to the steeple of`,
  `Meridian Street Methodist Church. My friends`,
  `don't believe me, but it's true—I mean, it's not`,
  `like I can prove it or anything—but I can see`,
  `the steeple, and the Baskin Robbins sign right`,
  `over the canal behind Rivi. I'm probably the`,
  `lightest one out of all my friends, and that's`,
  `why I go the highest. The funny thing is though,`,
  `whenever I'm a missile, I never get the urge to`,
  `twitch or bark—I guess it's just because I'm too`,
  `busy worrying about the flips and somersaults`,
  `that I'm gonna' do—one time when Abe launched me`,
  `I did three somersaults before I straightened`,
  `out for a perfect dive into the water. I'm`,
  `thinking I'll tell this to that doctor I'm`,
  `gonna' see today, since that is practically the`,
  `only time that I don't do it.`
], [
  `On the way to Riley Hospital my mom keeps`,
  `tellin' me that it's not a psychiatrist that I'm`,
  `gonna' see—but that it's a neurologist, whatever`,
  `that's supposed to be. She knows that I don't`,
  `like crazy people—and that they are the only`,
  `people that really scare me—more than the weird`,
  `things I hear in my room at night, when I'm`,
  `praying to Jesus to protect me from them. I`,
  `remember I used to be real scared of them when I`,
  `was little, until I got my first communion at`,
  `church. After that I figured I was off limits to`,
  `the monsters since I ate holy wafers on a weekly`,
  `basis. But Crazy Charlie doesn't count as a`,
  `crazy person to me—because it's not like he's a`,
  `psycho or anything—he just does funny twitches`,
  `and weird noises—not like the guys downtown who`,
  `talk to themselves and look like they're about`,
  `to kill somebody or somethin'. Those guys are`,
  `creeps, and I try to keep clear of them whenever`,
  `me and my mom go downtown to the post office.`
], [
  `When we get to the hospital I have to sit in`,
  `this waiting room that is made for little kids—`,
  `there is a box of toys and a pile of children's`,
  `books. I'm gettin' sorta' nervous though,`,
  `because my mom says I might have this disease,`,
  `and I don't want to have it—I figure that if I`,
  `can stop twitching while I'm with the doctor,`,
  `that he won't think I have it. I mean, I don't`,
  `really care if I have it—but my mom, she gets`,
  `all worried about it, like that one time she`,
  `even cried when my teachers at school said they`,
  `might take further action—and there's one thing`,
  `in the world that I can't stand, and that's my`,
  `mom crying. It's like I have to cry just because`,
  `my mom's crying—I don't even have to know what`,
  `it's about—I start in right along with her, and`,
  `ask her why she has to bawl when she knows it`,
  `makes me sad.`
], [
  `So anyway, I'm not a cry baby or anything—it's`,
  `just that one thing that does it to me every`,
  `time. So I'm thinking I'll hold in the urges to`,
  `bark and twitch for at least a few minutes while`,
  `the doctor's seein' me. That way he won't think`,
  `I have it, and my mom won't have anything to get`,
  `all worked up about.`
], [
  `But in the waiting room I'm really going at it`,
  `since the doctor's nowhere in sight—I pick up`,
  `this book I remember having when I was a kid,`,
  `The Cat In The Hat, and start reading it to get`,
  `my mind off the whole situation. Only the urges`,
  `are really coming at me now, since I've got this`,
  `great plan to hold 'em all in when the doctor`,
  `shows up. I'm flipping my head back and forth,`,
  `and can barely even read—I'm stomping my feet,`,
  `trying to get my toes through the soles of my`,
  `shoes. If I could, I'd curl my toes right`,
  `through the carpet and into the floor`,
  `underneath. I'm grunting every other second,`,
  `louder each time, and can't seem to get it`,
  `right.`
], [
  `That's the thing about it—it's like once you`,
  `start in on it, you've got to get it right.`,
  `Just like Crazy Charlie and his Olympic dives—if`,
  `it's off by just a little bit, you've got to do`,
  `it again. Especially with the barks—at first`,
  `everyone can barely hear it, but then I think`,
  `that they didn't hear it, and so I have to do`,
  `it again—but then I think that surely they`,
  `didn't hear that one either, and so on until the`,
  `whole class is staring at me, and I'm yanked`,
  `outta' the class by Sister Agatha and sent to`,
  `the principal's office.`
], [
  `I don't really wanna' look up at my mom now,`,
  `'cause I'm really having a fit, but when I do,`,
  `she is just staring at me like she usually does,`,
  `smiling, like what I'm doing is the most normal`,
  `thing in the world.`
], [
  `Luckily there's no one else in the room—I mean,`,
  `if there was a little kid in the room I'd really`,
  `be feelin' stupid—'cause sometimes little kids`,
  `look at me and then go over to their mom like`,
  `they're afraid of me or somethin'. The urges are`,
  `coming from all over, and I can't remember when`,
  `I've been so bad with it—but then the doctor`,
  `comes in and introduces himself to me, and not`,
  `to my mom, which I think is sorta' weird since`,
  `she is right there next to me. Adults are`,
  `always doin' weird stuff like that when I'm`,
  `around. They're always taking me aside and`,
  `asking "How are you, Chris? Is everything okay?"`,
  `like I'm some kind of retard or something. Not`,
  `that I have anything against retards, but it's`,
  `like I'm not retarded—I just twitch and stuff,`,
  `which isn't the same thing at all. Just like`,
  `Crazy Charlie really isn't crazy.`
], [
  `The doctor asks me to follow him down the hall`,
  `to his office where we can talk, and I'm waiting`,
  `for my mom to come with us, but she stays`,
  `behind. The doctor tells me he just wants to`,
  `talk to me for a minute. We're walking down the`,
  `hall and I'm really about to explode, 'cause`,
  `it's like there's all this energy going through`,
  `me like I've just been electrocuted—not that`,
  `I've ever been electrocuted before, but I'm`,
  `thinking this is what it would feel like if I`,
  `was. I'm sweating by the time we make it to his`,
  `office, which is like ten miles down the hall,`,
  `and he asks me again if everything's all right.`
], [
  `"I'm fine," I say.`
], [
  `"And are you holding back on anything? Is this`,
  `how you usually act?" he asks.`
], [
  `"Yes."`
], [
  `"Are you feeling the urge to make noises, or`,
  `shake your head?"`
], [
  `"No."`
], [
  `"Anything like that?"`
], [
  `"No." Only inside I'm fighting the itches like a`,
  `madman, and think maybe I'm not going to make it.`
], [
  `"It's just sorta' hot in here, that's all," I`,
  `say, 'cause I'm thinking he can see me sweating.`
], [
  `He says then that that's all he wanted to know`,
  `and takes me back to my mom. They are talking`,
  `right there in front of me, and right when I`,
  `think he's gonna' let us go, he asks me to go`,
  `down to the drinking fountain to get a sip of`,
  `water.`
], [
  `"I'm not thirsty," I tell him.`
], [
  `"Go on anyway, I have to talk to your mother for`,
  `a minute," he says.`
], [
  `And I'm thinking, yeah, like this isn't a test.`,
  `This guy is trying to make me do something, but`,
  `it's like the urges are starting to calm down a`,
  `bit, and so I walk real cool like down to the`,
  `drinking fountain, and feel the eyes of that`,
  `doctor on my back watching me like a hawk.`,
  `When I return without making a single jerk, I'm`,
  `smiling like I'm in on his secret test, and he`,
  `tells me I can go home now.`
], [
  `Right when we walk out the front door to the`,
  `hospital, I let out a nice big bark, and snap my`,
  `head right over to my mom to see if she heard`,
  `it, but she doesn't look at me and keeps on`,
  `goin' like nothing happened.`
], [
  `On the way home I ask her if I have the barks,`,
  `and what the doctor had said about me. She tells`,
  `me that I do have them and that we're goin' to`,
  `the pharmacy to get some medicine that'll make`,
  `it all better. I turn to face her and tell her`,
  `that I hadn't budged during the whole test, that`,
  `I knew about the test, and that I hadn't done`,
  `anything at all. Then she starts to cry, tears`,
  `running down to the corners of her mouth, and`,
  `she starts rubbing the back of my neck.`
], [
  `"The waiting room, Chris," she says, "he was`,
  `watching you in the waiting room."`
], [
  `And I'm thinking that was a dirty trick.`
], [
  `I end up taking this expensive medicine for a`,
  `week, but all it does is make me sleep almost`,
  `all day in school, and my mom says that's not`,
  `going to work, and I'm sorta happy, because`,
  `sleeping all day is not the sort of thing that I`,
  `like doin' on a regular basis.`
], [
  `Tonight we're supposed to have a conference at`,
  `school, and when me and my mom get there, all`,
  `the teachers are there at this big table, and`,
  `I'm at the end of it like it's my birthday or`,
  `something. Sister Agatha says that she didn't`,
  `know that the barks was a real disease, and how`,
  `she really did believe I was trying to get my`,
  `classmates to laugh. That sorta' made me feel`,
  `good, like she was the one in the hot seat—I`,
  `love watching adults get in trouble almost as`,
  `much as getting into trouble myself. But then`,
  `all of them start apologizing to me, which is`,
  `funny, because it's like a few weeks ago I was`,
  `getting detentions for all the trouble I was`,
  `causing, and was approaching the all-time record`,
  `for detentions in the entire history of the`,
  `school. I thought that was pretty cool, but my`,
  `mom said that it wasn't something to be proud`,
  `of, and that it wasn't like something I could`,
  `put on my resume, whatever the hell that's`,
  `supposed to mean.`
], [
  `I'm still sort of embarrassed about having a`,
  `disease and all that, and tell them that I don't`,
  `know what they're talking about—that I didn't`,
  `know anything about any "syndrome," all the`,
  `while shaking my head even harder, hoping each`,
  `time that they hadn't noticed the last jerk,`,
  `though they're looking straight at me. Everyone`,
  `starts staring real hard, like when I'm in`,
  `trouble and they're trying to figure out how to`,
  `get me to stop misbehaving. Only it's really bad`,
  `this time, and I can't stop the noises and`,
  `twitching, and my mom starts looking worried and`,
  `tells me to settle down. I keep hitting my knee`,
  `under the table and everyone looks down at the`,
  `table popping up and down, and then I'm shaking`,
  `my head back and forth like crazy, and barking,`,
  `and Sister Agatha stops talking to my mom about`,
  `what times I'm supposed to take the medicine at`,
  `school. Everyone is looking back and forth`,
  `between my mom and me, like they don't know what`,
  `to do, and then Principal Cohen says that maybe`,
  `my mom should take me home, but no one can hear`,
  `him 'cause I'm barking so loud, and finally I`,
  `kick the table so hard that everyone's coffee`,
  `mugs dump over onto the table and people start`,
  `getting up out of their seats. I finish it off`,
  `like a real pro and start shaking all over like`,
  `I've never shaked before, and end up falling`,
  `right outta' my chair.`
], [
  `They're all looking at me like I've just been`,
  `hit by a car or somethin', like this one time at`,
  `school when this little girl got run over by a`,
  `car at recess, and people came out of their`,
  `houses and just stood there staring, wondering`,
  `if the world was going to come to an end or`,
  `something.`
], [
  `I mean, I kinda' feel sorry for them—'cause I`,
  `know it's not like they're enjoying watch me`,
  `have a fit. Even Sister Agatha looks like maybe`,
  `she's not having a good time, and has lost that`,
  `evil look that she usually gives me when I turn`,
  `around in church to see if she's spyin' on me.`
], [
  `Me, I'm just wishing my mom would stop crying,`,
  `and that I could be back in the bullpen with Abe`,
  `so he could launch me nice and high—and then,`,
  `right when I get that great view of the`,
  `neighborhood, I can let out one last, perfect`,
  `bark, and that maybe that'll be the end of it.`
