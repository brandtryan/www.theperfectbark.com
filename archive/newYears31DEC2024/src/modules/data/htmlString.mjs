<span id='p00-ln03' class='line'>but only get a kick out of it—like when we are in the middle of a</span>
<span id='p00-ln04' class='line'>test or something, and then out of nowhere I let out a bark, I</span>
<span id='p00-ln05' class='line'>mean a loud bark, where everyone turns around to me and</span>
<span id='p00-ln06' class='line'>smiles, and then someone starts laughing, and then everyone</span>
<span id='p00-ln07' class='line'>else gets going. To tell you the truth it doesn't bother me at all,</span>

<span id='p01-ln00' class='line'>I go to this school where our teachers are mostly nuns—we</span>
<span id='p01-ln01' class='line'>have to go to  church every week, and sometimes I'll bark in</span>
<span id='p01-ln02' class='line'>church too. This one nun, Sister Agatha, told me that Jesus</span>
<span id='p01-ln03' class='line'>didn't appreciate me barking like that in church and disrupting</span>
<span id='p01-ln04' class='line'>everything. She's mean though it's funny—there's always that</span>
<span id='p01-ln05' class='line'>question about nuns—“is she mean?“—that everyone's always</span>
<span id='p01-ln06' class='line'>talkin' about whenever you find out who your teachers will be</span>
<span id='p01-ln07' class='line'>for the next year. It's always how mean Sister so and so is, and</span>
<span id='p01-ln09' class='line'>how this one cuts your hair when you're not looking if it grows</span>
<span id='p01-ln10' class='line'>too long and how another one will ask you to hold your palms</span>
<span id='p01-ln11' class='line'>out so she can smack’em with a ruler. My brother told me all</span>
<span id='p01-ln12' class='line'>kinds of horrible stuff about every nun I was gonna' have—but</span>
<span id='p01-ln13' class='line'>with Sister Agatha, he wasn't kidding. Yesterday, after telling</span>
<span id='p01-ln14' class='line'>me all about how Jesus didn't appreciate me disrupting His</span>
<span id='p01-ln15' class='line'>Mass, she smacked me in the back of the head, and told me</span>

<span id='p02-ln02' class='line'>and barking, though it never seemed to help. The way I see it, if</span>
<span id='p02-ln03' class='line'>He didn't want to help, then He probably didn't care too much</span>
<span id='p02-ln04' class='line'>if I did it in church. Sister Agatha and the rest of the teachers</span>
<span id='p02-ln05' class='line'>told my mom that I was forever disrupting the classes and</span>
<span id='p02-ln06' class='line'>Masses, and that they were thinking of taking further action if</span>
<span id='p02-ln07' class='line'>I didn't stop, whatever that's supposed to mean. What they</span>
<span id='p02-ln08' class='line'>were going to do I don't know—but my mom thought</span>
<span id='p02-ln09' class='line'>something was wrong with me anyway, especially after this</span>
<span id='p02-ln10' class='line'>one time when I called my basketball coach an asshole right to</span>

<span id='p05-ln00' class='line'>At first it was all a big joke—because there was this one guy at</span>

<span id='p05-ln02' class='line'>before he dove off the high dive and into the tank. He was an</span>
<span id='p05-ln03' class='line'>old man and he would do that same damn dive every time, like</span>
<span id='p05-ln04' class='line'>he was trying out for the Olympics or something—but every</span>
<span id='p05-ln05' class='line'>time his bony hands would hit the water palms up, and his one</span>
<span id='p05-ln06' class='line'>leg never seemed to be in line with the other one. Then he'd go</span>
<span id='p05-ln07' class='line'>up the ladder doing these weird twitches, stand at the end of</span>
<span id='p05-ln08' class='line'>the board, let out a bark, and then dive again. It wasn't like a</span>
<span id='p05-ln09' class='line'>little bark either—it was a huge bark, and everyone always</span>
<span id='p05-ln10' class='line'>heard it and would look up at his old ass getting ready to dive,</span>
<span id='p05-ln11' class='line'>and laugh. We imitated him a lot, walking around all the</span>
<span id='p05-ln12' class='line'>different parts of the pool, barking and twitching and yelling</span>
<span id='p05-ln13' class='line'>out “Crazy Charlie!”,’cause a lot of times Crazy Charlie himself</span>

<span id='p06-ln02' class='line'>all in one,’cause there are special parts of the pool for different</span>
<span id='p06-ln03' class='line'>types of things. There's the bullpen, which is my favorite,</span>
<span id='p06-ln04' class='line'>where only boys are allowed. If a girl gets caught in there she</span>
<span id='p06-ln05' class='line'>gets thrown out, and can't come back for a day. Then there's</span>

<span id='p07-ln03' class='line'>looked at me, like I was the one who started all of it, and</span>
<span id='p07-ln04' class='line'>barked right at me. Well, the only thing I could do was bark</span>
<span id='p07-ln05' class='line'>right back, and when I did, my friends all laughed real hard,</span>
<span id='p07-ln06' class='line'>and patted me on the back like it was a real good one or</span>

<span id='p08-ln00' class='line'>The thing that I remember though, is when Crazy Charlie was</span>
<span id='p08-ln01' class='line'>lookin' at me—it was like he musta' been thinking of how either</span>
<span id='p08-ln02' class='line'>he hoped we all got the barks so that we would stop laughing,</span>
<span id='p08-ln03' class='line'>or that maybe he was hopin' that we would never get’em,</span>
<span id='p08-ln04' class='line'>because it seemed to bother him a lot. Ever since that day I've</span>
<span id='p08-ln05' class='line'>been doin' the barks and twitches a lot, and I think maybe he</span>
<span id='p08-ln06' class='line'>gave’em to me when he looked right at me and I barked back at</span>
<span id='p08-ln07' class='line'>him. My mom says that's ridiculous, but she wasn't there to see</span>
<span id='p08-ln08' class='line'>the look Crazy Charlie gave me. It wasn't like an adult look—it</span>
<span id='p08-ln09' class='line'>was the look some kid gives you after you've made fun of him,</span>
<span id='p08-ln10' class='line'>like he really hates you, and would like to kill you right there</span>
<span id='p08-ln11' class='line'>on the spot.</span>

<p id='p09' class='para'>
<span id='p09-ln00' class='line'>In the bullpen there's this big guy that likes to launch me into</span>
<span id='p09-ln01' class='line'>the air like a missile. That's what they call me and my friends,</span>
<span id='p09-ln02' class='line'>missiles,’cause they take one of our feet in their cupped hands</span>
<span id='p09-ln03' class='line'>and launch us through the air to see how high they can throw</span>
<span id='p09-ln04' class='line'>us. Abe is the best launcher—he's the biggest human being I've</span>
<span id='p09-ln05' class='line'>ever seen, and when he launches me I can see over the fence of</span>
<span id='p09-ln06' class='line'>the club all the way to the steeple of Meridian Street</span>

<span id='p09-ln08' class='line'>I mean, it's not like I can prove it or anything—but I can see the</span>
<span id='p09-ln09' class='line'>steeple, and the Baskin Robbins sign right over the canal</span>

<span id='p09-ln11' class='line'>and that's why I go the highest. The funny thing is though,</span>
<span id='p09-ln12' class='line'>whenever I'm a missile I never get the urge to twitch or bark—</span>
<span id='p09-ln13' class='line'>I guess it's just because I'm too busy worrying about the flips</span>
<span id='p09-ln14' class='line'>and somersaults that I'm gonna' do. One time when Abe</span>
<span id='p09-ln15' class='line'>launched me I did three somersaults before I straightened out</span>
<span id='p09-ln16' class='line'>for a perfect dive into the water. I'm thinking I'll tell this to</span>
